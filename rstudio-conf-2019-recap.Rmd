# The Workshop

???

Notes:
- First, I'll talk about the workshop I attended on "Applied Machine Learning"

---

# Applied Machine Learning

For about 16 hours over the course of two days, two rooms of 350 people each 
went on a journey to learn the up and coming tools of tidy data science focused 
on modeling.

???

Notes: 
- They structured this workshop to take place in two parallel sessions, with 
  Max Kuhn splitting his time between the two.
- Two summer interns that worked with Max took on the other half of instruction.
- The setup was not executed well due to conflicting teaching styles and timing. 
- That said, this workshop was a great introduction to the packages they are 
  working on to tidy the world of modeling.
- All the slide decks for this workshop are on GitHub, and I have posted links
  on the #MachineLearning Slack channel.

- `parsnip` aims to provide a standard interface to modeling packages

???

Notes:
- First, the `parsnip` package, which is the spiritual successor to `caret`.
- `parsnip` aims to provide a standard interface to modeling packages and tools,
  such as `ranger` for random forests, `glmnet` for penalized regressions,
  and the basic `lm` function for regular regressions.

---

background-image: url('img/model-syntax.png')
background-size: contain 

???

Notes:
- This table was used to illustrate the problem `parsnip` wants to solve.
- Since these packages are typically designed in silos, without concern for
  standardization, there is great diversity in parameters, outputs, and 
  behavior.
- This objective of standardization appears to be a sort of prime directive 
  among these packages.

---

class: middle
```{r parsnip-setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(AmesHousing)

ames <- make_ames() %>%
    dplyr::select(-matches("Qu"))

set.seed(4595)
data_split <- initial_split(ames, strata = "Sale_Price")
ames_train <- training(data_split)
ames_test  <- testing(data_split)
```

```{r parsnip-demo}
spec_lin_reg <- linear_reg()
spec_lin_reg

spec_lm <- set_engine(spec_lin_reg, "lm")
spec_lm
```

???

Notes:
- Here, we see this notion of model "specifications", where you first tell 
  `parsnip` what you want to do.
- Then, you can set the "engine" for your specification, i.e. what package or 
  method do you want to use for executing your specification?
  
---

class: middle
```{r parsnip-demo2}
fit_lm <- fit(spec_lm, 
              log10(Sale_Price) ~ Longitude + Latitude,
              data = ames_train)
fit_lm
```

???

Notes: 
- Fitting the model is then done using a "fit" function. Here, the default fit
  function takes a specification, a formula, and data to train the model.
- The added value here is that if packages do not provide a formula method, 
  instead requiring you to set "y" to your outcome and "x" to your predictors,
  `parsnip` will do this for you.
  
---

class: middle

```{r parsnip-demo2b}
fit_lm <- fit_xy(spec_lm, 
                 y = log10(ames_train$Sale_Price),
                 x = ames_train[, c("Longitude", "Latitude")])
fit_lm
```

???

Notes:
- You are also free to specify your model in this "X-Y" format.

---

class: middle
```{r parsnip-demo3}
predict(fit_lm, new_data = ames_test)
```

???

Notes: 
- Then, you get a "predict" function. This prediction function also takes a `type`
  parameter, which takes one of a few standardized names, i.e. "class", "prob", 
  "conf_int", "pred_int", "quantile", etc.

# Applied Machine Learning

For about 16 hours over the course of two days, two rooms of 350 people each 
went on a journey to learn the up and coming tools of tidy data science focused 
on modeling.

- `parsnip` aims to provide a standard interface to modeling packages.
- `recipes` aims to provide a standard interface to preprocessing.

???

Notes:
- The next package, `recipes`, aims to provide a standard interface for data 
  preprocessing tasks. This package's design is really interesting!

---

class: middle

```{r, recipes-setup}
mod_rec <- recipe(
    Sale_Price ~ Longitude + Latitude + Neighborhood, 
    data = ames_train
  ) %>%
  step_log(Sale_Price, base = 10) %>%
  # Lump factor levels that occur in 
  # <= 5% of data as "other"
  step_other(Neighborhood, threshold = 0.05) %>%
  # Create dummy variables for _any_ factor variables
  step_dummy(all_nominal())
mod_rec
```

???

Notes: 
- The way this works is the recipe takes a formula and a data frame, which
  serve to provide the recipe object with metadata (column names, types) and
  a beginning understanding the role of each column that matters.
- The recipe is made up of "steps", which take the form of "do this transformation
  to these columns". There are a large number of provided steps, as well as the
  ability to create custom steps or embed `dplyr` verbs in steps.
- Because this is ultimately a lazy object, that is, a plan of what will be done, and
  the set of variables can change from step to step and be dependent on data (such as
  `step_other`), it provides these selector-helpers, such as `all_nominal`. 
  `dplyr` selectors like `matches` or `starts_with` also work.
- The cool thing about this recipe object is that it is built incrementally,
  so you could take a recipe as one version of your feature engineering, and then
  build upon it into another recipe with more steps. 
- This design seems particularly interesting when considering how we might approach
  designing packages for CR, especially for `minuteman`, which has a lot of 
  specification steps that are often subject to sensitivities.

---

class: middle

```{r, recipes-prep}
mod_rec_trained <- prep(mod_rec, training = ames_train, 
                        verbose = TRUE)
mod_rec_trained
```

???

Notes: 
- Once you have a recipe, you `prep` it on training data. Effectively running it. 
- Certain steps, like `step_other`, do have this notion of "training". Consider
  what might happen if the test data, for example, has a `Neighborhood` value the
  training dataset did not. This recipe, since it has been prepped, will know to 
  put those in the "Other" category.
- The `prep` function, by default, retains the prepared training data. This data
  can be accessed using the `juice` function, in case you want to do anything
  with that, such as EDA or visualizations.
  
---

class: middle

```{r, recipes-bake}
ames_test_dummies <- bake(mod_rec_trained, new_data = ames_test)
ames_test_dummies
```

???

Notes:
- Once you have a prepped or trained recipe, you can `bake` it using new data,
  such as your test data.
- On the naming scheme here, Max explains that he really just wanted to stick with
  the theme of cooking, and felt that the `juice` and `bake` names fit well
  with the difference between these functions. Your agreement might vary.

# Applied Machine Learning

For about 16 hours over the course of two days, two rooms of 350 people each went on a journey to learn the up and coming tools of tidy data science focused on modeling.

- `parsnip` aims to provide a standard interface to modeling packages.
- `recipes` aims to provide a standard interface to preprocessing.
- `rsample` aims to provide a standard interface to resampling.

???

Notes:
- Next, `rsample` aims to address the resampling part of this workflow, namely
  bootstrapping and cross validation.
  
---

background-image: url('img/resampling.png')
background-size: contain 

???

Notes:
- Max spent a not-insignificant amount of time talking about how he believes
  people should "spend their data", which is visualized in this chart.
- The idea is you should initially split your data into training and test sets,
  saving the test set for the very end, so that you do you not develop towards
  optimizing for the test set. 
- Then, to make the most use of your training set, you should resample it, creating
  `k` pairs of "training" and "test" sets. To disambiguate between the grand training
  and test sets and these resampled versions, he terms the resampled versions
  "analysis" and "assessment". 
  
---

class: middle

```{r, rsample-demo}
set.seed(2453)
cv_splits <- vfold_cv(
  data = ames_train, 
  v = 10, 
  strata = "Sale_Price"
)
cv_splits %>% 
    slice(1:6) %>% 
    mutate(analysis_df = map(splits, analysis),
           assessment_df = map(splits, assessment))
```

???

Notes:
- The implementation makes use of list columns, generating a data frame where
  each record represents a split of the training data. 
- Here, I am using the `map` function to extract the "analysis" and "assessment"
  data frames from the `splits` column into separate columns. However, the promoted
  way to do this would be to use the `analysis` and `assessment` functions within 
  functions that bake a recipe, assess fit, etc.
- The benefit here is that within the organizing structure of a data frame, we 
  can organize resampling specifications, the preprocessing recipe, and measures of
  fit all within one row.

# Applied Machine Learning

For about 16 hours over the course of two days, two rooms of 350 people each went on a journey to learn the up and coming tools of tidy data science focused on modeling.

- `parsnip` aims to provide a standard interface to modeling packages.
- `recipes` aims to provide a standard interface to preprocessing.
- `rsample` aims to provide a standard interface to resampling.
- `dials` aims to provide a standard interface to grid searching.

???

Notes:
- Then there is the `dials` package, aimed at the model tuning workflow.

---

class: middle
```{r, dials-demo}
param_grid <- neighbors %>%
    range_set(c(1, 10)) %>%
    grid_regular(levels = 10)
param_grid
```

???

Notes:
- Here, we are setting up a grid for the hyperparameter in a KNN model ("K").

---

class: middle
```{r}
spec_knn_varying <- nearest_neighbor(
    neighbors = varying()
) %>%
    set_engine("kknn") %>%
    set_mode("regression")
spec_knn_varying
```

???

Notes:
- We are then setting up a nearest neighbor model specification, indicating the
  intention to grid search the neighbors hyper parameter.

---

class: middle
```{r}
param_grid <- param_grid %>%
    mutate(specs = merge(., spec_knn_varying))
param_grid
```

???

Notes:
- Then we merge the specification and the parameter grid.

---

class: middle
```{r}
param_grid$specs[[1]]
```

???

Notes:
- And we can see the model specifications are now fully hyper-parameterized.

---

???

Notes:
- Ultimately, the `tidymodels` family of packages, including these and more, including
  the `broom` package for extracting standard and tidy summaries and details from model objects,
  is all about developing this workbench for modeling and solving the problem endemic 
  among R packages: a lack of standardization.

# Keynotes

???

Notes:
- Next I want to briefly discuss the keynotes. These are going to be posted online
  and those videos will do them more justice than I am capable of in this presentation.

# Keynotes

## Joe Cheng (CTO, RStudio) 
### [Shiny in Production](https://speakerdeck.com/jcheng5/shiny-in-production) 

???

Notes:
- Joe Cheng talked about Shiny in Production. While we do not make use of shiny that
  much, this talk made it very clear RStudio is very interested in helping people
  better argue for using Shiny (and R in general) in production environments.
- Of specific note, this talk was largely about the more developer / engineer aspects
  of developing things like Shiny apps. Concepts like testing (both the R functions
  underlying the app as well as integration testing) and profiling.

## Felienne (Associate Professor, LIACS)
### [Explicit Direct Instruction in Programming Education](http://www.felienne.com/archives/6150)

???

Notes:
- This was a really great talk about the state of programming education, and the
  conflict between the incumbent "learning programming should be about fun and
  exploring" camp and the more evidence-backed "programming education should be 
  guided, direct, even at the expense of fun" camp.
- The speaker did her PhD dissertation about how Excel is a DSL for finance, and
  explaining that Excel is functional, reactive, and Turing complete.

--

## David Robinson (Chief Data Scientist, DataCamp)
### [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Public Work](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jk7216yr30ztpdp/DavidRobinson-RStudio-2019.pdf?dl=0)

???

Notes:
- This was a really inspiring talk about learning and working in public, largely
  via twitter (short-form sharing), blogs (medium-form sharing), and books (long-form sharing),
  in addition to screencasts (new-age sharing) and packages.
- The pitch is that maintaining a public body of work is great for your professional image,
  growth, and exposure to the community.

# Talks

???

Notes: 
- Now I'll link to some of the talks I found particularly interesting, along 
  with the slides.
- The conference was live streamed, so these videos should be coming out soon.
- However, some talks, especially in the first block, had atrocious audio-video
  issues.

# Interop

## Wes McKinney
### [Ursa Labs and Apache Arrow in 2019](https://www.slideshare.net/wesm/ursa-labs-and-apache-arrow-in-2019)

???

Notes:
- Wes lost half his talk to A/V issues. The main pitch is that a lot of compute
  time and headaches is wasted on serializing data for interop between tools.
- Wes and his Ursa Labs, supported by RStudio and other companies, wants to 
  tackle this with the Apache Arrow project, and this effort is ongoing.

## Jonathan McPherson
### [New Language Features in RStudio 2019](https://github.com/jmcphers/rstudio-1.2-features)

???

Notes:
- RStudio 1.2 is going to be a great release for using Python and SQL with RStudio.
- With the `reticulate`, RStudio can embedded a Python session within the R session,
  allowing for execution of Python code (from Python scripts).
- RStudio will also support running code from SQL files against a connection.
- RStudio will also have a job launcher, which at its simplest will allow for 
  launching background source jobs from within RStudio, and at its most complicated
  will allow launching a containerized job to a different compute context.
- RStudio had a series of blog posts about this.

### [Databases Using R: The Latest](https://db.rstudio.com/tidypredict/)

???

Notes:
- The Databases Using R talk largely focused on BigQuery and the cool things
  they are doing with dplyr-generated SQL queries.
- The exciting thing about this talk was the `tidypredict` package, which can
  translate the prediction function of certain models (including `lm`, `ranger`)
  into SQL queries.
  
---
# `tidypredict`

```{r}
library(tidypredict)

lm_model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
tidypredict_sql(lm_model, dbplyr::simulate_dbi())

rf_model <- ranger::ranger(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars, num.trees = 2)
tidypredict_sql(rf_model, dbplyr::simulate_dbi())
```

# Package Management

## Sean Lopp
### [Announcing RStudio Package Manager](https://www.rstudio.com/products/package-manager/)

???

Notes: 
- One of my goals at this conference was to understand what the RStudio Package Manager
  was and if it solved a problem for us.
- At its core, RStudio Package Manager is a shiny interface on top of an internal
  package repository (CRAN, packages from GitHub, internal packages), with tools
  for version control and analysis of package licenses.
- If we wanted to pay $5,000 to block all CRAN mirrors (+ GitHub?) and have an 
  internally hosted CRAN repo, with extensive versioning information, this is
  the product for us. \$10,000 gets us a high-availability license, and \$25,000
  gets us unlimited repositories.
- The use case for this appears to be for companies where users are installing 
  packages themselves, or people are launching containerized jobs which need to 
  install very specific versions of packages.

# Package Management

## Gabor Csardi
### [`pkg`: A Fresh Approach to Package Installation](https://github.com/r-lib/pkg)

???

Notes:
- This talk on the `pkg` package, currently early in its lifecycle but being actively
  developed, demonstrated a safer, faster, more robust vision of how `install.packages`
  could work.
- It solves dependencies up front and detects conflicts.
- It downloads and installs packages in a concurrent manner.
- It aims to not screw up your package environment if an installation fails.
- The most valuable thing I got out of this presentation was this notion of a
  project-specific package library, and I think it solves a problem we face:
  how do we provide R packages to specific teams without providing those packages
  at the system level, a de facto endorsement.

---

# Package Management Proposal

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# In dapg-internal program:
# (Re)-create project-specific directory
unlink("/projects/eg-example/Rproj_lib")
dir.create("/projects/eg-example/Rproj_lib")

# Install packages to project-specific directory
install.packages(
    pkgs = c("xlsx"),
    libs = "/projects/eg-example/Rproj_lib" 
)

# In case header: 
.libPaths(c("/projects/eg-example/Rproj_lib", .libPaths()))
```

???

Notes:
- What I propose is we maintain a Git repo in dapg-internal with scripts that
  look like the above. They create a case-specific directory and install case-specific 
  packages to that directory.
- Then, we insert a command in the case team's header that adds that directory 
  to the beginning of the package load priority.

---

# Programming Talks

## Hadley Wickham
### [`vctrs`: Tools for Making Size and Type Consistent Functions](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/)

???

Notes: 
- Hadley kicked off the programming talks with a discussion of a package to resolve
  some shortcomings of base R. Namely, how R coerces data types when vectors are
  concatenated.
- This package is intended for package developers.
- The existence of this furthers this role RStudio and Hadley are taking as providers
  of an infrastructure for the R community to build upon. 
  
---

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# combining factors makes integers
c(factor("a"), factor("b"))
#> [1] 1 1

# combing dates and date-times give incorrect values
dt <- as.Date("2020-01-1")
dttm <- as.POSIXct(dt)

c(dt, dttm)
#> [1] "2020-01-01"    "4321940-06-07"
c(dttm, dt)
#> [1] "2020-01-01 00:00:00 UTC" "1970-01-01 05:04:22 UTC"
```

---

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#> [1] a b
#> Levels: a b

dt <- as.Date("2020-01-1")

vctrs::vec_c(dt, dttm)
#> [1] "2020-01-01 00:00:00 PST" "2019-12-31 16:00:00 PST"

#> [1] "2019-12-31 16:00:00 PST" "2020-01-01 00:00:00 PST"
```

## Jenny Bryan
### [Tidy Eval in Context](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/tidy-eval-in-context)

???

Notes:
- Jenny Bryan gave a great talk in defense of Tidy Eval, which is "basically"
  non-standard evaluation, which is "basically" name quoting.
- This presentation also contains strategies for solving problems using existing
  (and easier to use) tools, such as scoped verbs in dplyr.

--

## Lionel Henry
### [Selecting and Doing with Tidy Eval](https://speakerdeck.com/lionelhenry/selecting-and-doing-with-tidy-eval)

???

Notes:
- Lionel Henry, an RStudio package maintainer, followed with a talk about how to 
  use tidy eval in the context of selecting columns and doing things to columns.
- I thought this presentation would make for a great introduction into how to work
  with tidy eval, to be followed by the "Programming in dplyr" article and Hadley's
  "Advanced R" book.
  
---

# Miscellaneous Talks

## Rich Iannone
### [Introducing the `gt` Package](https://gt.rstudio.com/)

???

Notes:
- This might have been the most packed talk I attended. 
- The `gt` package provides a really pleasant interface for incrementally building
  HTML, emailable tables. (Open link and explore GitHub repo).
- While we do have `crtables` already, I think this package might be great for 
  inspiration and possibly even integration, if it provides the low level access
  we need for theming.

--

## Angela Bassa 
### [Data Science as a Team Sport](https://github.com/angelabassa/rstudioconf-2019)

???

Notes:
- There were a series of talks about "Organization Thinking". This one focused
  on the challenges of Data Science in organizations.
- "Just because a data scientist can do everything doesn't mean they should". The
  can-do-everything attitude leads to a foundation of technical debt.
- Teams should grow for scope and maturity, not speed -- by definition, adding
  someone does not mean other team members can work faster. Additional workers
  require additional time and investment, but can enable larger scope of work
  and group maturity.
- How to grow: add specialization (Practice area, technical expertise), 
  add processes (Documentation, Governance, Automation), and resilience (
  hiring, on-boarding, culture, and inclusion).

# Development Day

???

Notes:
- On the Saturday after the conference, there was a Tidyverse Developer Day,
  where around 50-70 people gathered to work on issues in and around the Tidyverse.
- It was a great experience to meet several developers, learn how other organizations
  handle contributing to R packages, and contribute to the tools I use every day.
- I learned a couple nifty things about Rcpp, specifically printing things!
- I talked to Jim Hester, a maintainer on the `odbc` package I've talked to in the
  past about Netezza encoding issues. The problem is still not solved, and likely
  whatever solution, R side, would require changes to encoding settings that would
  cause problems elsewhere.

# Final Thoughts

???

Notes:
- Next year's conference is in San Francisco, January 27 to 30th. I _highly_ 
  recommend attending if you can.
- Attending the conference is exhausting but ultimately rewarding for the 
  exposure you get to the community and the tools members of communities use. 
- I found this year was especially great because I have more experience solving
  problems at Cornerstone and can better evaluate or identify things that would
  be helpful in work.
